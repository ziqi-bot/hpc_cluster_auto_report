# HPC Usage Report  
**Auto-Generated by Llama 3.1-8B — Analytical Summary**

This repository contains scripts and SLURM workflows for automatically generating
usage and utilization reports for the UNBC High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster.
The reports are produced using structured system data and summarized by a large
language model (Llama 3.1-8B).

## Cluster Utilization

The UNBC HPC cluster has been utilized extensively over the past year, demonstrating
its importance to researchers across various departments. The high number of completed
jobs indicates efficient use of available computational resources, while the relatively
low failure rate suggests effective job scheduling and job management practices.

---

## Departmental Breakdown

Notably, the **Chemistry** department has dominated cluster usage, accounting for nearly
half of all jobs submitted. This is followed closely by **Environmental Science**, which
has also shown significant engagement with the cluster.

These results highlight the interdisciplinary nature of research at UNBC, where multiple
departments collaborate and rely heavily on shared computational infrastructure.

---

## Job Completion Rate

A notable achievement is the **64.5% job completion rate**, indicating that the majority
of submitted jobs were successfully executed within their allotted time frames. This
underscores both the robustness of the cluster infrastructure and the growing expertise
of its user base.

---

## Failed Jobs Analysis

Failed jobs account for approximately **20.7%** of total submissions. Given the complexity
and experimental nature of many HPC workloads, this rate is not considered alarming.
Instead, it suggests that users are progressively adapting to the cluster environment
and improving workflow efficiency.

## Conclusion

Looking ahead, these statistics suggest that the UNBC HPC cluster will continue to play
a vital role in supporting cutting-edge research across disciplines such as chemistry,
environmental science, physics, and computer science.

As computational demand grows, continued investment in cluster maintenance and upgrades
will be essential. By leveraging the strengths of the HPC cluster, researchers can unlock
new discoveries, advance knowledge, and push the boundaries of scientific understanding.

The future holds great promise for the UNBC research community, and the HPC cluster stands
poised to play a pivotal role in shaping that future.
